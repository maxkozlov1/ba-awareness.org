Biliary Atresia Awareness Campaign
===================================
BA-Awareness.org is meant to be a place where patients, family members and the wandering eye to find information on Biliary Atresia. Information like: What is Biliary Atresia? What are the Symptoms? Is there a cure? and so on. Currently on the hospitals page there will be a list of the best hospitals in the United States to go to for Liver Treatement.

The Future
----------
Some Future Features I plan on adding to BA-Awareness.org are:
* A Google (Bing?) Maps interface where a user enters their zip code and certain parameters and a dynamically generated list of nearby hospitals (within certain parameters). When clicking on a hospital on the list the user should find a information page on the hospital and a small map of the surrounding area.
* A Forum system specifically designed for support groups
* A Stories upload form, possibly using markdown/BBcode and/or HTML.
* Possibly a blog.

Built With
----------
* Ruby
* Sinatra
* Valid HTML/CSS (custom theme coming soon and will be using HTML5/CSS3)
* Heroku
